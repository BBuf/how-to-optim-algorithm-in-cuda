# 连接数学和代码：CuTeDSL中的 CuTe Layout代数

19 May, 2025

## Complementation

## Introduction

This week the `CUTLASS` team released a new version of `CUTLASS` which introduces `CuTeDSL` a python interface which gives the user access to * core concepts such as layouts, tensors, hardware atoms, and full control over the hardware thread and data hierarchy* as can be read in their dedicated documentation(https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/pythonDSL/overview.html).

In this blogpost we aim to give a basic understanding of some principles of `CuTe` layout algebra. We will explain some basic concepts like the layout function, coalescing and complementation. This can be helpful for a deeper understanding of the `CuTeDSL`.

## Layout

We define a Layout as
